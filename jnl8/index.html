Cities’ relationship with water is a fragile balance. Too little leads to parched landscapes and water shortages; too much can cause deadly flooding, washing away homes, lives and livelihoods.

Completed in 2017, the 11-acre park (45,000 square meters) is designed to work with and capture water. Built on a slope, it is able to funnel water through its gardens and artificial wetlands, then into a retention pond.

Perhaps its most ingenious feature lies out of sight. Underneath the park are underground tanks able to hold 160,000 gallons of water. Altogether the park can hold up to one million gallons of water.

The concept for the park came from the idea of monkey cheeks, Voraakhom told the New York Times. Monkeys use their cheeks to store food to eat when he’s hungry; that’s what the park aims to do with water.

Green spaces can also help reduce air pollution and reduce the urban heat island effect, where dense, concrete-heavy cities trap heat. While Centenary Park is only a tiny slice of the city, Voraakhom said it’s an example of what can be done.

China, which suffers from both flooding and drought, has long been an advocate of “sponge cities.” The idea is to enable cities to soak up and retain excess water with designs focused on nature, including gardens, green roofs, wetlands and permeable sidewalks – allowing water to both sink into the ground and flow outwards.

In 2015, the government announced a pilot scheme of 16 sponge cities, prompted in part by severe flooding which hit Beijing in 2012, killing nearly 80 people and causing widespread damage. Many more projects have since been added.

“All cities are trying to resist water like an enemy,” said architect and professor Kongjian Yu, founder of design firm Turenscape and the pioneer of sponge cities. The aim of sponge cities is to “give water more space,” he told CNN.

Yongxing River Park in Beijing is one of Yu’s many sponge city projects. Formerly a concrete drainage channel, Turenscape turned it into a “sponge river,” designed to manage floodwaters and filter rainwater.

A network of paths connects the park, which is full of plants and trees, including willow, crab apple and hawthorn trees. It also has playgrounds for children as well as a sports ground.

As sponge cities proliferate in China, there have been some questions about their ability to cope with heavier rains and storms, made more severe by climate change. In 2021, the city of Zhengzhou, in Henan province, which is part of the sponge city initiative, experienced devastating rains that killed almost 300 people.

But for Yu, sponge cities offer a necessary correction to the mistakes that have been made as cities grow, including damaging and destroying rivers and wetlands and heavy reliance on concrete.
